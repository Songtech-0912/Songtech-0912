## About Me ðŸ‘‹

I am a high school student who's an enthusiast in the world of free and open-source software! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Project ElÃ¤ra](https://github.com/elaraproject)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently self-learning Rust, Python, Web Design and UI Design
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a code refactoring of [my personal open-source code editor](https://github.com/Songtech-0912/Pyrite)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about open-source, software design, and everything in between!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a hopeless Vim user despite acknowledging VS Code is the best code editor
